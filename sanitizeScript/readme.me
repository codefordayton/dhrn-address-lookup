This script will take csv tax file from (TODO find and add link) and output a clean csv that only contains the data we need. 

It removes extra columns and removes the extra padding that is around all the fields. 


It expects the file to be named tax.csv and will output a file named cleanData.csv

TODO

Add missing link in readme.

Make script more robust for when file is missing, add error that links to where the file can be gotten from.
